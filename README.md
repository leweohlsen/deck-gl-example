# deck.gl Performance test

Rendering many points and polygons with deck.gl in a React app to test performance and user experience.

# TODO
- [ ] Update the react app to actually use deck.gl to render a large tiled image
- [ ] Render a large number of points on the map (configurable via UI)
- [ ] Render a large number of polygons on the map (also config via UI)
- [ ] Get nebula.gl on board to check if interactions work with many annotations
